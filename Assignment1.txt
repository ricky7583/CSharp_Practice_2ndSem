1.Create a table named DEPT based on the following chart. 
 
create table DEPT(
    ID number(7) primary key,
    NAME varchar2(25)
);
desc DEPT

b) Run another Insert statement / command 
INSERT INTO DEPT (ID , NAME) VALUES  (40, ‘Accounting’) ;   
Explain if this insert run successfully and added record this time? NO  
Why?
unique constraint (COMP122_W21_ERS_155.SYS_C00852365) violated
Because the value that tried to INSERT is already the primary key of the table and the value already exists. The value of the primary key can’t be duplicated.
P.S: Make sure you rewrite these INSERT statements in SQL Developer by yourself  or if you copy paste from this word document then fix (rewrite) single ‘  ‘ quote.

2) Add two new columns to this DEPT table  (Manager_ID and City Columns)
a)
Column Names	Manager_ID	City
Key Type		UNIQUE KEY
Data Type	NUMBER	VARCHAR2
Lenght	5	30

Hints: Use ALTER TABLE ADD column command
ALTER TABLE XXXXX  ADD  Manager_ID ……
ALTER TABLE XXXXX  ADD City   ……
ALTER TABLE DEPT ADD Manager_ID NUMBER(5);
ALTER TABLE DEPT ADD City VARCHAR2(30) UNIQUE;
 
Then also run another ALTER TABLE command to add constraint for Unique Key on City column.
ALTER TABLE XXXXX  ADD CONSTRAINT
ALTER TABLE DEPT ADD CONSTRAINT city UNIQUE(City);

b) Use DESCRIBE command to show final structure of DEPT table. Get command and your result copy paste here and also capture screen shot of your SQL Developer and place here.
desc DEPT

CREATE TABLE EMP(
    ID NUMBER(7),
    LAST_NAME VARCHAR2(25),
    FIRST_NAME VARCHAR2(25),
    DEPT_ID NUMBER(7),
    CONSTRAINT DEPT_ID FOREIGN KEY(ID) 
    REFERENCES DEPT(ID)
);

4.  Create the new table name EMPLOYEE2 based on your existing Employees table.  Use Clone / Copy techniques from another table by using SELECT statement.
Include only EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY and DEPARTMENT_ID columns.
When you develop your SELECT statement for Create Table include employees only who work for Department 50 or 60.
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE2
AS (SELECT ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DEPT_ID FROM EMP WHERE DEPT_ID = 50 OR DEPT_ID = 60);
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE2 ADD SALARY NUMBER(7);
SELECT*FROM EMPLOYEE2;
