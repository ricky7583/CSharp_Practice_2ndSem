Date related functions and examples

1)how to find how many days past from the day we hire each employees?
SELECT employee_id, last_name, first_name, SYSDATE - hire_date AS numofday
FROM EMPLOYEES

2) How to find how many weeks past from the day we hire each employee?

SELECT employee_id, last_name, first_name, (SYSDATE - hire_date)/7 AS numofweeks
FROM EMPLOYEES

round this this number to closest 2 digit

SELECT employee_id, last_name, first_name, ROUND ( (SYSDATE - hire_date)/7,2 ) AS numofweeks
FROM EMPLOYEES

3) How to find how many months past from the day we hire each employee?

SELECT employee_id, last_name, first_name, ROUND ( (SYSDATE - hire_date)/7,2 ) AS numofweeks
FROM EMPLOYEES
this above one is not scientific

Scientific one is the one using MONTHS_BETWEEN
SELECT employee_id, last_name, first_name, MONTHS_BETWEEN (SYSDATE , hire_date) AS numofmonths
FROM EMPLOYEES

SELECT employee_id, last_name, first_name, TRUNC (MONTHS_BETWEEN (SYSDATE , hire_date),0) AS numofmonths
FROM EMPLOYEES


Q5)
Find out min , max , avg salary , total employee numbers, total salary for entire company?
SELECT MIN (salary) , MAX(salary) , AVG(salary),COUNT(*),SUM(salary) FROM employees

Q6)
Find out min , max , avg salary , total employee numbers, total salary for all employees who work in
either department 60 or 90, 110 ?
SELECT MIN (salary) , MAX(salary) , AVG(salary),COUNT(*),SUM(salary) FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (60,90,110)

Q7)
Find out min , max , avg salary , total employee numbers, total salary for all employees who
work as job_id somehow %SA% ?

SELECT MIN (salary) , MAX(salary) , AVG(salary),COUNT(*),SUM(salary) FROM employees
WHERE UPPER (job_id) LIKE '%SA%'

Rule... When you want to find out total count.. inside COUNT function always use either * or primary ekey
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees --- it checks priamry key employee_id and finds total employees
SELECT COUNT(employee_id) FROM Employees
-- buuuuut do not use any other column for this purpose such as commission_pct

SELECT COUNT(employee_id) FROM Employees -- Rioght answer
SELECT COUNT(commission_pct) FROM Employees -- Wrong answer

to to make correct use NVL function and convert nulls to 1
SELECT COUNT( NVL( commission_pct,1)) FROM Employees -- Right answer



MIN and MAX functions can work with numbers values and /or date values.

Q7) find out what is the latest date we hired any employee (mind you i am not asking who we hired latestO)
